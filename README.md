# NYC Citi Bike Analysis 
This is a summary of the analytic work that I did with the NYC Citi Bike data.

## A bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa

### City population and potential subscribers
Although compared to New York City, the population of Des Moines is nowhere near the population of a city of that magnitude. According to data provided from Census, New York City has a population of 8,398,748 as of 2018, while Des Moines is 216,853. In comparison by volume, New York City is much larger, and the bigger the population, the more likely customers will be signing up for a bike-sharing app like Citi Bike. New York city has 2,344,224 customers on the citi bike app, which is 27.9% of the population, and of those customers, 1,900,359 are annual subscribers (22.6%), which are considered long term users. 

If we take those percentage ratios, and assume Des Moines can get the same ratios with their population of 216,853, that can turn to 60,502 customers with 49,009 annual subscribers. That is still a lot of business annually!

### Population per square mile
You can also look at population per square mile for both cities. While it is still a significant difference between Des Moines and New York city, per square mile, Des Moines still has as of the year 2010, 2,516 people per square mile, which is still a lot of people that could be using citi bikes if they were made available to travel. You can also come to the conclusion that since population has increased in 2018, that people were square mile will increase as well, meaning there will be more people signing up for Citi Bike app.

### August bike usage in NYC as potential for usage in Des Moines
There is a consistent number of bike usage in New York City, especially in months like August. This is why a program like Citi Bike app, which allows bike-sharing is successful in New York city. According to website "www.catchdesmoines.com" a very popular activity and thing to do in Des Moines is biking. They offer a lot of bike tours. A bike-sharing program could greatly compliment such tours. You can also argue that in a city that isn't as crowded, it may be safer to ride bikes with less traffic.

### Bike Repairs and Utilization
Another benefit of having a lot of bikes available and in usage is, over time, due to wear and tear, bikes will be damaged and need repairs. As shown in charts in the tableau story, business from bike repairs will provide consistent business as well.
